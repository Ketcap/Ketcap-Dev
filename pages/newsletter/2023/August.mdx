## <a href='#challenge'>Challenge</a>

This month's challenge is all about types. We want to implement a type called `Last<T>` which will give us the last value in the array as a type. Let's check the example:

```js
type arr1 = ["a", "b", "c"];
type arr2 = [3, 2, 1];

type tail1 = Last<arr1>; // expected to be 'c'
type tail2 = Last<arr2>; // expected to be 1
```

This challenge is coming to you from my favourite places to test myself and solve some challenges.
