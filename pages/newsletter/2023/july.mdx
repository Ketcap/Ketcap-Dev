## <a href='#challenge'>Challenge</a>

JS Challenges all about solving problems that arises from it. So this time letâ€™s try to make our own implementation of Array and we should be able to run this code block below:

```js
const office = array("Dwight Schrute", "Jim", "Kevin", "Angela", "Pam"):

// Add to array (.push)
office.hire("Michael", "Oscar", "Ryan", "Andy", "Toby");
// Remove from array
office.fire("Kevin");

// Filter array (.filter from array)
const meetingRoom = office.meeting((employee)=> {
  return employee !== "Michael";
});

// meetingRoom =>  All the employees except Michael
```

1. `array(...args)` should create an array and return that array.

2. `hire(...args)` function should push to array.

3. `fire(arg)` function should remove a given element from the array

   - Extra 1: If you pass exact object that is in the array it will remove that.

   - Extra 2: It can take callback function to remove the element(s). Ex: `office.fire((employee)=> boolean))`

4. `meeting(callback)` should filter the array.

If you want to make it more challenging you can make every function is type-safe and typed correctly. Good luck and have fun ðŸ¥³
