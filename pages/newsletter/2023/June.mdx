### Massive Bug on npm Ecosystem

npm is one of the biggest package managers for JavaScript ecosystem along side with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) and [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/). But this does not mean it's better and most secure system. Ex-Staff-Engineer from npm CLI team mentioned the issue where: when you install a package can lead to un-secure installs and execution of malicious scripts.

## <a href='#challenge'>Challenge</a>

Javascript is always an interesting language to show us to it's skills. Some of those skills can be good, bad, ugly. Let's see without running this code piece if you can figure out what will be logged.

```js
let sharedVariable = "initial";

setTimeout(() => {
  sharedVariable = "updated by first timeout";
}, 500);

setTimeout(() => {
  if (sharedVariable === "initial") {
    console.log("Shared variable not yet updated");
  } else {
    console.log("Shared variable was already updated");
  }
}, 500);
```

### Answer

The answer is "Shared variable was already updated" but that does not mean this will be always true. Because JavaScript puts the `setTimeout` function on an event loop first setTimeout will be called out first. So if you swap the orders of `setTimeout` you will receive "Shared variable not yet updated". So be careful while playing with this.
