As new projects are kicking off and ongoing projects are scaling up, different problems have arisen. The ecosystem is growing a lot with new versions and updates. Let‚Äôs see what we have this month.

We are not using Redux every day, but still, the reducer pattern is something we can use in React directly. And they might have some problems. So let‚Äôs see if you can figure that out. (If you run code it will tell you immediately actually üòâ )

```js
function todoReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "ADD_TODO":
      const todos = state.todos;
      return { ...state, todos: todos.concat(action.payload) };
    case "REMOVE_TODO":
      const todos = state.todos;
      const newTodos = todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== action.id);
      return { ...state, todos: newTodos };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

`const` and `let` are block-scoped. It means they need to have different scope for the same variable name for todos , or you can change the name of the variable. The new scope is defined with {} after ‚Äúcase".

```js
function todoReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "ADD_TODO": {
      const todos = state.todos;
      return { ...state, todos: todos.concat(action.payload) };
    }
    case "REMOVE_TODO": {
      const todos = state.todos;
      const newTodos = todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== action.id);
      return { ...state, todos: newTodos };
    }
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

</details>
