## <a name="#challenge">Challenge</a>

We are using features of ecmascript and the different libraries but do you know what this code does?

```js
const friends = ["Neo", "Trinity", "John", "Peralta", "Jake", "Morpheus"];

const { length, 0: first, [length - 1]: last } = friends;
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>
Using destructure is not only for objects. You can actually use for arrays too. So the case we have is actually working code that returns.

```js
{
  length: 6,
  0: "Neo",
  5: "Morpheus"
}
```

So next time when you need to access spesific location of an array you can use this.
