When you work with Date and Timezones itâ€™s a always tricky situation. The conversion of timezones and correct display of time to the user is a problem many of us faced in the past.

Given an array of people and their timezones in UTC, write a function to return the local time for a given person. Maybe you would like to solve for a 12 or 24-hour clock!

```js
// Time 14:00 UTC
let humans = [
    { name: 'John', timezone: 'UTCâˆ’1:00' },
    { name: 'Neo', timezone: 'UTC+2:00' }
    { name: 'Trinity', timezone: 'UTCâˆ’3:00' }
]

localTime('Neo')
16:00pm // Check the time above to see if it's correct (it will change on your usage and when you run)
```
