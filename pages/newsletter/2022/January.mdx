## <a name="#news--explore">News & Explore</a>

Let‚Äôs see what has been going on and what are people around the world have been creating. Here you can find a curated list for you this month.

### Open Source goes sideways

This month creator of fakerjs has deleted the repo, unpublished all the versions on npm, and changed the title to What really happened with Aaron Swartz?. It affected too many libraries and companies that use this library either directly or indirectly via the packages they use. Just a recap this library receives downloads over 2.8m weekly.

### Migrate the new library, not the new version

The new year is starting fast with multiple projects, companies migrating switching tools for their needs, and Storybook has decided and moved away from styled components to emotion with zero bugs.

### State of JavaScript 2021 Survey

It might be late to get the survey of 2021 but even the 2020 Olympics done in 2021 so why not. You might want to contribute to the survey.

### Hard to find unimported files

While development is ongoing it might be hard to handle all the files and components, and unimported files are hard to catch. So there might be a tool for this problem. The project called ‚Äúunimported‚Äù is here to clean the code.

### Solving Advent of Code with eval.

Eval? Do we even use that? I would say it seems handy from time to time. To solve puzzles it works like a charm.

### Vercel launching Platforms Starter Kit

What is this kit? It‚Äôs a template for building multi-tenant applications with built-in custom domain support. Interested? It‚Äôs even free.

### Porting SWC to GO

### Storybook plugin for Figma

Designers and developers checking each others' work are hard always. So why not unify in 1 place. Using Storybook in Figma is something to look for.

### Sharing is not easy always

Not between ourselves but in social media and platforms. Writing code for sharing is always a pain. So no dependency library here to save us. Sharer.js has implemented 20 social media to share what is needed.

## <a name="#challenge">Challenge</a>

Most of us either heard or know the game called wordle. So what about challenging ourselves to make an interview question out of it.

If you didn‚Äôt hear about it check it on here and if you are a native Czech speaker you would like to play it in your own language see here. Kudos to for making a Czech version of it.

Using the rules of Wordle, given the guess word and a solution word returns a set of emojis returned from the guess word. Example for you

```js
let solutionWord = "fudge"

$ wordleGuess("reads", solutionWord)
$ "‚¨õüü®‚¨õüü®‚¨õ"

$ wordleGuess("lodge", solutionWord)
$ "‚¨õ‚¨õüü©üü©üü©"
```
