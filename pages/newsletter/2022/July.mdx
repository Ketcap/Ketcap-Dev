Some string work needed this month from you.

Given a string that has a valid email address, write a function to hide the first part of the email (before the @ sign), minus the first and last character. For extra credit, add a flag to hide the second part after the @ sign to your function excluding the first character and the domain extension.

```js
> hideEmail('email@something.com')
> 'e***l@something.com'

> hideEmail('ugur+something@something.com', hideFull)
> 'u**********c@s******.com'
```
