## <a name="#challenge">Challenge</a>

When it comes to challenges on JS there are plenty. This one is particularly interesting. Let‚Äôs see if you can spot the bug and fix it ü§î

```js
class User {
  async constructor(userId) {
    const user = await getUser(userId)
    this.id = user.id;
    this.name = user.name;
    this.email = user.email;
  }
}
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

Unfortunately, JavaScript class constructors do not allow you to run ‚Äúasync‚Äù functions. So you need another method to do this.

```js
class User {`
  static async init(userId) {
    const user = await getUser(userId);
    return new User(user);
  }
  constructor(user) {
    this.id = user.id;
    this.name = user.name;
    this.email = user.email;
  }
}
```

</details>
